rose2018ng-fair-metaboliteprofile
==============================

A FAIRification project aiming at recovering GC-MS based metabolite profiles of Rose scent published in Nature Genetics, in June 2018, demonstrating the use of Frictionless Tabular data package, Semantic markup of chemicals with CHEBI ontology and InCHI for annotation, markup of measurements with STATO ontology, and insisting on the need to clarify the semantics of data matrices. A full Linked Data (LD) representation is provided and visualization of the metabolite profiles in 6 rose strains and 3 plants parts is presented.
